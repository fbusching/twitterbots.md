## Twitter bots with no code
This is a tutorial for students who might need to use a twitter bot for classes that might need it. It could also be used for people who think it would be an interesting project to try.



## Before building the bot.

**Etiquette** of course, before you make a twitterbot, you must follow the twitter guidlines and rules. otherwise your bot will get kicked and you will spend more time making new bots than seeing them work. hre is a link to a list of things your bot cant do.

## Basics of a bot.
the first thing you have to do is make  a twitter acount for your bot to have. be sure to verify both a phone number and email.

After you have an acount, you can make an app with twitter. you can go here, to apps.twitter.com <https://twitter.com/login?redirect_after_login=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.twitter.com%2Fapps>, to build an application for your bot. Click the create new app button and it will pull up a new menu.

Give it the same name as your acount and a short description. give the app a name. leave the callback url section empty. it wiil be he last step while making the app.

## Completing the app setup
your app will have 3 tabs at the top of its menu. Detail, keys/access tokens, and permissions. go to the keys/access tokens tab and click the "create my access token". this will give you 4 random codes called the consumer key, access token, consumer secret, and the access token. make sure it will be easy for you to find that pagefor later
