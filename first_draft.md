## Twitter bots with no code
This is a tutorial for students who might need to use a twitter bot for classes that might need it. It could also be used for people who think it would be an interesting project to try.



## Before building the bot.

**Etiquette** Of course, before you make a twitterbot, you must follow the twitter guidlines and rules. otherwise your bot will get kicked and you will spend more time making new bots than seeing them work. hre is a link to a list of things your bot cant do.

## Basics of a bot.
The first thing you have to do is make  a twitter acount for your bot to have. be sure to verify both a phone number and email.

After you have an acount, you can make an app with twitter. you can go here, to apps.twitter.com 

[apps.twitter.com](https://twitter.com/login?redirect_after_login=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.twitter.com%2Fapps), 

To build an application for your bot. Click the create new app button and it will pull up a new menu.

Give it the same name as your acount and a short description. give the app a name.

## Completing the app setup
Your app will have 3 tabs at the top of its menu. Detail, keys/access tokens, and permissions. go to the keys/access tokens tab and click the "create my access token". this will give you 4 random codes  
*consumer key 

*access token

*consumer secret 

*access token. 
(make sure it will be easy for you to find that page for later.)

## putting the bot to work
the next step would be to go to labnol.org/bots:

[labnol.org/bots](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbwWSRgdQ7ji6TH1njlimjZiM81M7MdHA34BliELlrANouhfIBXz/exec)

Go the choose what  to the page you have your 4 codes and copy them into their appropriate space. 
select a search on twitter, decide the amount of time your bot will run for,and choose what you want your bot to do under "actions". Then choose what your bot will say. hit save and it will run.
One thing to remember, you can change what your first bot does, but once you want to make another bot, you have to pay for it.
## Example
I currently have a bot running on twitter called @trvestuff and it retweets tweets with the key words "climate change is real" from 10:30 am -1:00 pm.
Building a bot this way takes about 10 to 20 minutes so it is not difficult to do just to test it out. I encourage you to try it.
